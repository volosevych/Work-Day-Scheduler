<b>DESCRIPTION</b>

In this homework assignment we had to create a daily planner that can manage your time effectively. 

<b>So... How it works?</b>

When you open the daily planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. If scroll a little bit down you presented with time blocks for standard business hours, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. You can enter an event and click the save button for that time block, if you would like to refresh the page, your event still will be there even if you return the next day.
